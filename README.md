## Reflection
After building a user review site for light novels using Express.js and Node.js, I found EJS templating challenging. I was overwhelmed by the documentation, which made the learning curve steep regardless of my current experience level. This confusion also made it harder to debug issues in my other routes, as I wasnâ€™t always sure if the problem was with my server logic or if it had to do with EJS. I had issues with my PUT and DELETE requests, where an error would activate but the request would be fufilled and reflect it sucessfully. 

Moving forward, I plan to explore other templating or rendering options that might better suit my workflow and skill level. Hopefully when we get to React things will be less difficult to render.
